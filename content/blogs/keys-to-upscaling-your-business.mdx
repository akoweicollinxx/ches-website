As a business owner, you must be prepared to explore unconventional and innovative options to remain competitive. You must be willing to pivot from the security of structured forecasts and plans to pursue and experience business growth. While scaling your operations inherently carries risk, the right strategy can help you avoid common mistakes, upscale your company successfully and set it up for a sustainable future. We’ll explain what’s involved in scaling your business and share best practices for successful growth.

**How to scale your business**

Your business has many different aspects, each of which must expand and support your overall growth plan. Here’s a step-by-step guide to scaling your business.


**1. Ensure your business is ready to scale**

Successful growth requires meeting specific criteria. Consider the following crucial characteristics when determining whether your business is ready to scale:

***Strong demand:*** Is there a robust market demand for your products or services? Have you kept your business competitive? Consider your sales numbers and how much your profits have grown and evaluate your market research and how competitive your business is in the space.  
***Excellent financial management:*** Your business must have solid financial management practices in place to accurately assess the capital needed for growth and the ability to manage your funds responsibly. Signs of solid financial management include appointing an internal chief financial officer and a competent accounting and finance team. You may also consider hiring a certified public accountant (CPA) to benefit from outside financial expertise.  
**Growth-oriented culture:*** Before scaling your business, you must ensure it has a growth-oriented and flexible culture. Without one, your organization won’t be able to quickly adapt to new people, increased demand and updated processes.



**2. Create a growth plan and budget**

Consider how quickly you want to grow and what resources you’ll need to accomplish your goal. These factors will inform your growth plan and budget. Create a realistic and conservative budget (one that assumes higher costs to cover any contingencies), so you know how much you’ll realistically need to invest in your growth plan. 

Incorporate revenue forecasts into your growth plan and budget. Estimate when you expect to see additional revenue and how much. These forecasts will help you determine the timing of distributions from your internal or investment growth fund. As you implement the plan, your finance team should monitor your progress continuously against the forecast and make necessary adjustments.


**3. Obtain and set aside your growth investment funds**

Expanding your business requires dedicated funding. Before moving forward with your growth plan, ensure you have enough financing earmarked for your initiatives. It’s important to note that your growth investment funds should be separate from the money allocated for current operating expenses. The amount you set aside will depend on how aggressive your growth plan is and may need to be substantial.

If your sales are strong and profit margins are high, you may already have sufficient funds generated from your operations. If not, you must decide if you want to finance your growth with equity from an angel investor or venture capitalist or apply for a business loan.

**4. Work with suppliers to increase the supply of products and raw materials**

Call your existing suppliers and let them know about your growth plans. Determine if they can handle increased shipments in a timely manner. If so, now would be a great time to negotiate better terms, whether extended payment timelines or a volume discount. If they can’t handle the extra orders, look for and vet suppliers that can provide the extra output you need.


**5. Hire additional staff as necessary**

If your growth plan involves hiring for your business, prepare a plan detailing your open positions, their salaries and your hiring timeline. For example, you may need to hire outside salespeople and customer service reps urgently, while you may eventually need to hire additional staff for your billing department. Your needs will determine your recruitment strategy and timeline. 

Many companies outsource business processes to grow their business if they need people temporarily to implement a growth plan. If you go this route, carefully evaluate your outsourcing partner to ensure it can fulfill your needs cost-effectively.

**6. Reevaluate and modify internal processes**

Increased business and additional staff will likely prompt you to modify processes and operations. As workloads increase, some jobs might need to be delegated to other employees and other tasks might be eliminated or automated to increase productivity. 


**7. Implement the necessary technology to support your growth**

As your company grows, it will become more challenging for employees to perform operations manually or undertake processes with multiple steps. Streamline your operations by investing in technology and workflow automations that will improve productivity and free your team. 

For example, instead of manually counting inventory items, consider implementing a  radio-frequency identification system that instantly accounts for palettes full of goods. Other tech investments include automating customer support emails, using Slack to boost productivity and communication and automating accounts payable processes. 

**8. Create and execute a marketing and sales plan to reach your growth goals**


Your sales revenue is a vital component of achieving profitable growth. To help you achieve your growth goals, creating and executing a sales and marketing plan to boost your revenues is crucial. Your plan may include new marketing initiatives, stepped-up advertising spending or hiring new sales representatives.

Consider incorporating existing personnel and tools to fuel your expanded marketing and sales efforts. For example, have current account representatives email customers and prospects about new products or form a co-marketing relationship with a complementary company servicing the same market.
